# OpenDoñita

OpenDoñita is a server designed to work with the **Conga 1490/1590** robotic vacuum cleaners distributed by **Cecotec**
in Spain. Since it is really a robot manufactured by the chinese company **robot bona**, it is very probable that it
would work with other robots.

All the documentation is in my personal blog: https://blog.rastersoft.com/?p=2324 (in spanish).

## Using OpenDoñita

### The easy way

**tbd**

![The app works, but no Conga is found](capture4.png)

After having done this, you can jump to **Conecting the robot to the new server**

## Connecting the robot to the new server

Now there are three ways of connecting the robot to the server:

* turn off the WiFi router and turn on again (or stop *hostapd*, wait some seconds, and start it again if you are using
an isolated WiFi network)

* or turn off the robot for some seconds and turn on it again. This requires removing it from the charging base and
turning it off with the lateral switch.

* or pair it manually as specified in the next section.

## Pairing the robot manually

## Using the new app

Now you can open the main app in a browser just by typing the IP address of your RPi.

In the main screen you have four buttons:

The *home* button: when it is filled of color, it means that the robot is not in the base. Clicking on it will send it
to the charger.

The *play* button: this triangle starts a new clean cycle, and will change to a square (or *stop*) button, which will
stop the clean cycle.

The *map/manual control* button: it alternates between MAP mode and MANUAL CONTROL mode.

The *settings* button: this button will open a popup where it is possible to choose the fan power, the water flux, the clean mode and the sound mode:

This configuration will be remembered even if the robot is turned off and on again.

During cleaning, the app will generate the map in real time:

![Map example](capture3.png)

Doing a displacement with the finger over the screen (or with the mouse) will rotate the map 90 degrees in the specified direction.

## REST API

The server offers a REST API and a full HTTP server running at port 80. It recognizes the following paths and objects:

* **/baole-web/common/sumbitClearTime.do**: part of connecting negotiation process
* **/baole-web/common/getToken.do**: part of connecting negotiation process
* **/baole-web/common/**: part of connecting negotiation process
* **/robot**: commands for managing and controlling the robots
* **anything else**: the file will be searched in the *html* folder

Every time a call returns something, it will be a JSON file, with the exception of getMap, which will return a PNG
directly. The format of a JSON response is:

    {
        "error": error_value,
        "value": data_to_be_returned
    }

**error** is a numerical value. The possible values are:

0. No error
1. Missing robot ID
2. Invalid robot ID
3. Robot is not connected to the server
4. Robot still not identified in server
5. Unknown command
6. Missing parameter
7. Invalid value (like "out of range", or similar)
8. Key doesn't exist in persistent data

If the error value is zero, then *data_to_be_returned* can be an array, a dictionary... something dependent on the command
executed. But if the error is not zero, then *data_to_be_returned* will be an string.

Under the **robot** path you can use **/robot/list** to get a list of the currently available robots connected to the server.
In the returned JSON, *data_to_be_returned* will be an array with zero or more strings. Each string is a robot identifier,
which can be used in the other commands.

To send an specific command to a robot, you use a path with the following format:

    /robot/robot_id/command

or, if the command requires parameters, then:

    /robot/robot_id/command?param1=value1&param2=value2...

In both cases, *robot_id* is an id returned by **/robot/list**, but can be replaced with *all*, and the command will be sent
to all the robots currently connected. The commands are stored in a queue and sent one by one to the robot.

The available commands are:

* **clean**: orders the robot to start cleaning
* **stop**: pauses the cleaning operation
* **return**: orders the robot to return to the base
* **updateMap**: orders the robot to send a map update
* **askStatus**: orders the robot to send an status update
* **notifyConnection**: notifies the robot that a web client has been opened
* **mode**: allows to set the cleaning mode. It has one parameter, *type*, with any of these values:
    * auto
    * gyro
    * random
    * borders
    * area
    * x2
    * scrub
* **fan**: sets the fan speed. It has one parameter, *speed*, with a value from 0 to 3 (bigger value means more speed)
* **watertank**: sets the watertank speed. It has one parameter, *speed*, with a value from 0 to 3 (bigger value means more speed)
* **sound**: allows to enable or disable the buzzer. It has one parameter, *status*, with a zero value to disable it, or one value
to enable it.
* **goForward**: manual control. Makes the robot to advance. Must be resent periodically (every two seconds) to keep it active, or the server will stop the movement automatically.
* **goBack**: manual control. Makes the robot to move backwards. Must be resent periodically (every two seconds) to keep it active, or the server will stop the movement automatically.
* **turnLeft**: manual control. Makes the robot turn counterclockwise. Must be resent periodically (every two seconds) to keep it active, or the server will stop the movement automatically.
* **turnRight**: manual control. Makes the robot turn clockwise. Must be resent periodically (every two seconds) to keep it active, or the server will stop the movement automatically.
* **stayStill**: manual control. Makes the robot to stop the last movement order sent.
* **wait**: allows to wait a configurable number of seconds before continuing executing the commands in the queue. It has one parameter,
*seconds*, with a float/integer value expressing the number of seconds to wait.
* **waitState**: allows to wait for the robot to be in an specific state before continuing executing the commands in the queue. It has one parameter, *state*, which can have any of these values:
    * cleaning
    * stopped
    * returning
    * charging
    * charged
    * home
* **getStatus**: allows to get the current status of the robot. *data_to_be_returned* will contain a dictionary with data obtained from
the pairing process, from *status* events, or from *error* events.
* **setStatus**: allows to modify an entry in the status. Usually the entry value will be overwritten again when the robot updates its
state, but some entries (like *error*) can be useful to be modifiable. It receives one or more parameters, being the name of the entry
or entries to be modified and their new value. It returns a dictionary with the new *status* values.
* **getProperty**: allows to get a property. Properties are non-volatile pairs of *key*-*value*, useful to store the configuration of
the robot, or other things. If no parameter is passed, a dictionary with all the properties is returned; instead, if a *key* parameter
is passed, only the value for the key specified by it will be returned.
* **setProperty**: allows to set a property value. It receives two parameters: *key*, with the key to set or modify, and *value*, with
the new value. The new value is stored in permanent storage immediately. All values are converted into strings before being stored.
* **setDefaults**: sets the fan, water and clean mode in the robot to the values stored in the properties.
* **getMap**: returns a PNG picture with the current map. Accepts two parameters: *width* and *height* for the PNG size. The default
values are 640.
